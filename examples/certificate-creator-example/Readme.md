# Serverless Certificate Creator Example

This example shows a common way to use this plugin. It creates a lambda fronted
by an api gateway. The basepath is mapped to the configured domain (this is done
with the
[serverless-domain-manager](https://github.com/amplify-education/serverless-domain-manager)).
The required certificate is then created with the serverless-certificate-creator
plugin.
